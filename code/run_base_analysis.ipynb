    "# Non-Random Patterns in Stochastic Social Network Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes from the Professor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good choice of dataset, relevant and rich for temporal analysis and holistic modeling of dynamic social networks.\n",
    "- FOCUS ON CLASS 7 MATERIAL: Dynamic social networks, influences by hubs in time:\n",
    "  - Threshold (deterministic) vs independent cascade models (probabilistic)\n",
    "  - Information diffusion models (markov chains, SIR/SIS?)\n",
    "- Understanding a network by modeling the network creation process is a key aspect:\n",
    "  - For example, our user-user interaction network has a pareto distribution of node degrees\n",
    "  - Can we model this network generation process? Can we simulate similar networks with a Barabási-Albert (BA) extended model or other?\n",
    "  - Could it be modeled as a stochastic block model (SBM) or an extension like the dynamic SBM?\n",
    "- Consider also modeling how network evolves over time (social network dynamics).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equilibrium dynamics:** Do user-user interaction networks in r/Documentaries exhibit stationary transition probabilities and satisfy detailed balance conditions despite continuous microscopic rewiring?\n",
    "2. **Hub persistence:** To what extent do overlapping community/hubs (identified via BigCLAM) maintain their structural positions across temporal snapshots, and what role does bursty switching dynamics play in hub collapse?\n",
    "3. **Community evolution:** Can we model community evolution using spatiotemporal graph Laplacians and detect non-random patterns in what appears to be stochastic community fragmentation?\n",
    "4. **Predictive stability:** Given features derived from network motifs, sentiment analysis coherence, and temporal activity patterns, can we predict which communities will maintain structural integrity across time windows?\n",
    "5. **Sentiment coevolution:** How does sentiment polarization (measured via VADER) co-evolve with community structure, and does sentiment homogeneity predict/is related to community stability?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset useful information / metadata (from the source website)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scope:** Timestamps from their creation up to **October 2018**.\n",
    "* **Structure:**\n",
    "  * Each **subreddit** has its own corpus (`subreddit-[name]`).\n",
    "  * Each **post + comment thread** is a *conversation*.\n",
    "  * Each **comment or post** is an *utterance*.\n",
    "  * Each **user** is a *speaker* (identified by Reddit username).\n",
    "* **Utterance-level fields:** ID, speaker, conversation ID, reply-to ID, timestamp, text, score, gilding info, stickied status, permalink, and author flair.\n",
    "* **Conversation-level fields:** Title, number of comments, domain, subreddit name, gilding, stickied status, and author flair.\n",
    "* **Corpus-level fields:** Subreddit name, total posts, total comments, and number of unique speakers.\n",
    "* **Usage:** Can be downloaded as a zip file or loaded with `convokit`, and combined with other subreddit corpora for cross-community analysis.\n",
    "* **Notes:**\n",
    "  * Some subreddit data may be incomplete or contain broken thread links.\n",
    "  * Large subreddits may have very large corpus files.\n",
    "  * Speaker counts may be inflated due to duplicates in preprocessing.\n",
    "  * Dataset is **beta** and subject to updates for completeness and data consistency."
